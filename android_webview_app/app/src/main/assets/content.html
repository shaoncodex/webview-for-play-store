                    <p>This is an example of content that would be available offline in the WebView App. The content is stored locally in the app's assets folder, allowing users to access it even without an internet connection.</p>
                    
                    <p>In a real application, this section would contain actual content relevant to your app's purpose. This might include articles, tutorials, reference materials, or any other type of content that would benefit from offline access.</p>

                    <h3>Article 2: Advanced Features</h3>
                    <p>The WebView in this app is configured to support modern web features including JavaScript, allowing for interactive content experiences even in offline mode.</p>
                    
                    <p>Content can be organized into categories, tagged for easy searching, and structured in a way that makes navigation intuitive and user-friendly.</p>

                    <h3>Article 3: Customization Options</h3>
                    <p>The WebView App can be customized to meet specific needs and preferences. This might include theme options, font size adjustments, or other features that enhance the user experience.</p>
                    
                    <p>As an offline-first application, the WebView App prioritizes local content access while still allowing for content updates when an internet connection is available.</p>
